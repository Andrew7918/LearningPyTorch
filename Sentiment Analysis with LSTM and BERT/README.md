# Sentiment Analysis with LSTM and BERT

This is a project done in my journey of learning PyTorch. Here, I trained LSTM and BERT to do sentiment analysis, which takes text as input and outputs the sentiment behind the text. You can view this is as a classification problem.   

The code is documented with explanations to help you learn various aspects of PyTorch from general data preparation, all the way to model training and evaluation.

## Things Covered
1. Preparation of textual data (Preprocessing and Vocabulary classes)
2. Setting up custom datasets (Dataset, DataLoader, Collate classes)
3. Model building (LSTM, Transformer, BERT ?)
4. Model training 
5. Model and results evaluation 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.



## Usage
The code was originally written in Google Colab, so to access the colab file directly click this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F_jX_jqVZejysRCN631Vpn6uR92v-d7E?usp=sharing). Feel free to make a copy and play around with it.
